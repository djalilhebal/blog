> Curveship is a system for automatic narrative variation: It can relate the same underlying events in different ways, expressing the same content via different narrative discourses. Curveship can tell events out of order, as with flashback. It can designate different characters as the narrator or narratee (the one telling or the one to whom the narrative is told), and, for instance, can tell the story from a standpoint before, during, or after the events themselves.
