# CSS


## Methodologies

### BEM

You know.

### RSCSS

- [RSCSS](https://github.com/rstacruz/rscss)
    * "Reasonable System for CSS Stylesheet Structure."
    * "RSCSS pretty much follows BEM conventions, only with a different syntax."
      -- https://rstacruz.github.io/rscss/other-resources.html
    * 2023-11-18 Checked.
    * Uses [`docpress`](https://github.com/docpress/docpress) to generate the website. Looks neat.
    * As far as I know, BEM does not require (or recommend) using 2 word names for blocks.
      They used `menu` as a block name in their examples.


## Tailwind CSS

- [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) (by Vercel) generates Tailwind code.
